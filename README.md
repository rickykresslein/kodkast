# Kodkast
Kodkast is a minimal yet powerful podcast player.

## More info...
Kodkast is simple and lightweight, but contains all the tools you may require or desire when listening to podcasts. You can listen at 1x-2x playback speed, skip backwards or forwards, and play/pause. Who needs to do more?

## Getting Started
You can download the binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac on my website, [https://kressle.in/projects/kodkast](https://kressle.in/projects/kodkast), or you can download the source here to compile it yourself.

## Use
The program does not contain a podcast browser yet, so to add a podcast you will need to copy and paste the link to the podcast's RSS feed (usually found on the podcast's website). Kodkast will take it from there.

Kodkast parses all the data from the podcast link you provide and adds the podcast to your subscriptions list. Double-click the podcast to view the episodes. When playing an episode, Kodkast will remember your place, even if you close the app, so there is no need to search for where you were next time you go to listen.
