## More info...
Kodkast is simple and lightweight, but contains all the tools you may require or desire when listening to podcasts. You can listen at 1x-2x playback speed, skip backwards or forwards, and play/pause. Who needs to do more?

## Getting Started
You can download the binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac on my website, [https://kressle.in/projects/kodkast](https://kressle.in/projects/kodkast), or you can download the source here to compile it yourself.

You must install [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) for Kodkast to work.

## Use
Just click "Add Podcast" and add a podcast by searching the built-in iTunes database or input a feed URL. Double-click the podcast to view the episodes. When playing an episode, Kodkast will remember your place, even if you close the app, so there is no need to search for where you were next time you go to listen. Podcasts are played within Kodkast--no need to open an external media player.
